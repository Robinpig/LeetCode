# [0846. Hand of Straights](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/hand-of-straights/)



## Description



Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= hand.length <= 104`
- `0 <= hand[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`

 

**Note:** This question is the same as 1296: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/

### **Golang**

```go
func isNStraightHand(hand []int, groupSize int) bool {
    if len(hand)%groupSize > 0 {
        return false
    }
    sort.Ints(hand)
    cnt := map[int]int{}
    for _, num := range hand {
        cnt[num]++
    }
    for _, x := range hand {
        if cnt[x] == 0 {
            continue
        }
        for num := x; num < x+groupSize; num++ {
            if cnt[num] == 0 {
                return false
            }
            cnt[num]--
        }
    }
    return true
}
```
