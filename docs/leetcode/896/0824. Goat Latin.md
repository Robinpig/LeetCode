# [0824. Goat Latin](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/goat-latin/)



## Description


You are given a string `sentence` that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

- If a word begins with a vowel (

  ```
  'a'
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  'e'
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  'i'
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  'o'
  ```

  , or

   

  ```
  'u'
  ```

  ), append

   

  ```
  "ma"
  ```

   

  to the end of the word.

  - For example, the word `"apple"` becomes `"applema"`.

- If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add

   

  ```
  "ma"
  ```

  .

  - For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.

- Add one letter

   

  ```
  'a'
  ```

   

  to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with

   

  ```
  1
  ```

  .

  - For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end, and so on.

Return *the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sentence = "I speak Goat Latin"
Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence.length <= 150`
- `sentence` consists of English letters and spaces.
- `sentence` has no leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.

### **Golang**

```go
var vowels = map[byte]struct{}{'a': {}, 'e': {}, 'i': {}, 'o': {}, 'u': {}, 'A': {}, 'E': {}, 'I': {}, 'O': {}, 'U': {}}

func toGoatLatin(sentence string) string {
    ans := &strings.Builder{}
    for i, cnt, n := 0, 1, len(sentence); i < n; i++ {
        if cnt > 1 {
            ans.WriteByte(' ')
        }
        start := i
        for i++; i < n && sentence[i] != ' '; i++ {}
        cnt++
        if _, ok := vowels[sentence[start]]; ok {
            ans.WriteString(sentence[start:i])
        } else {
            ans.WriteString(sentence[start+1 : i])
            ans.WriteByte(sentence[start])
        }
        ans.WriteByte('m')
        ans.WriteString(strings.Repeat("a", cnt))
    }
    return ans.String()
}
```
