# [0884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/)



## Description


A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is **uncommon** if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and **does not appear** in the other sentence.

Given two **sentences** `s1` and `s2`, return *a list of all the **uncommon words***. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `s1` and `s2` do not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s1` and `s2` are separated by a single space.

### **Golang**

```go
func uncommonFromSentences(s1 string, s2 string) []string {
	freq := make(map[string]int)

	insert := func(s string) {
		words := strings.Split(s, " ")
		for _, word := range words {
			freq[word]++
		}
	}

	insert(s1)
	insert(s2)

	ans := []string{}
	for word, occ := range freq {
		if occ == 1 {
			ans = append(ans, word)
		}
	}
	return ans
}
```
