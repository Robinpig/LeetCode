# [0859. Buddy Strings](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/buddy-strings/)



## Description



Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` *if you can swap two letters in* `s` *so the result is equal to* `goal`*, otherwise, return* `false`*.*

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "aaaaaaabc", goal = "aaaaaaacb"
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.

### **Golang**

```go
func buddyStrings(s, goal string) bool {
    if len(s) != len(goal) {
        return false
    }

    if s == goal {
        seen := [26]bool{}
        for _, ch := range s {
            if seen[ch-'a'] {
                return true
            }
            seen[ch-'a'] = true
        }
        return false
    }

    first, second := -1, -1
    for i := range s {
        if s[i] != goal[i] {
            if first == -1 {
                first = i
            } else if second == -1 {
                second = i
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return second != -1 && s[first] == goal[second] && s[second] == goal[first]
}
```
