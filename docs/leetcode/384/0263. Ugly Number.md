# [0263. Ugly Number](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/ugly-number/)



## Description


An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *is an **ugly number***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Solutions

### Golang

```go
var factors = []int{2, 3, 5}

func isUgly(n int) bool {
    if n <= 0 {
        return false
    }
    for _, f := range factors {
        for n%f == 0 {
            n /= f
        }
    }
    return n == 1
}
```
