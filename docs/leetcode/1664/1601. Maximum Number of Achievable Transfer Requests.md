# [1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-number-of-achievable-transfer-requests/)



## Description


We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.

**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return *the maximum number of achievable requests*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg)

```
Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 3
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests. 
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
- `requests[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`

### **Golang**

```go
func maximumRequests(n int, requests [][]int) (ans int) {
next:
    for mask := 0; mask < 1<<len(requests); mask++ {
        cnt := bits.OnesCount(uint(mask))
        if cnt <= ans {
            continue
        }
        delta := make([]int, n)
        for i, r := range requests {
            if mask>>i&1 == 1 {
                delta[r[0]]++
                delta[r[1]]--
            }
        }
        for _, d := range delta {
            if d != 0 {
                continue next
            }
        }
        ans = cnt
    }
    return
}
```
