# [1609. Even Odd Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/even-odd-tree/)



## Description



A binary tree is named **Even-Odd** if it meets the following conditions:

- The root of the binary tree is at level index `0`, its children are at level index `1`, their children are at level index `2`, etc.
- For every **even-indexed** level, all nodes at the level have **odd** integer values in **strictly increasing** order (from left to right).
- For every **odd-indexed** level, all nodes at the level have **even** integer values in **strictly decreasing** order (from left to right).

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *return* `true` *if the binary tree is **Even-Odd**, otherwise return* `false`*.*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/sample_1_1966.png)

```
Input: root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]
Output: true
Explanation: The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [1]
Level 1: [10,4]
Level 2: [3,7,9]
Level 3: [12,8,6,2]
Since levels 0 and 2 are all odd and increasing and levels 1 and 3 are all even and decreasing, the tree is Even-Odd.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/sample_2_1966.png)

```
Input: root = [5,4,2,3,3,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [5]
Level 1: [4,2]
Level 2: [3,3,7]
Node values in level 2 must be in strictly increasing order, so the tree is not Even-Odd.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/22/sample_1_333_1966.png)

```
Input: root = [5,9,1,3,5,7]
Output: false
Explanation: Node values in the level 1 should be even integers.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 106`

### **Golang**

```go
func isEvenOddTree(root *TreeNode) bool {
    q := []*TreeNode{root}
    for level := 0; len(q) > 0; level++ {
        prev := 0
        if level%2 == 1 {
            prev = math.MaxInt32
        }
        size := len(q)
        for _, node := range q {
            val := node.Val
            if val%2 == level%2 || level%2 == 0 && val <= prev || level%2 == 1 && val >= prev {
                return false
            }
            prev = val
            if node.Left != nil {
                q = append(q, node.Left)
            }
            if node.Right != nil {
                q = append(q, node.Right)
            }
        }
        q = q[size:]
    }
    return true
}
```
