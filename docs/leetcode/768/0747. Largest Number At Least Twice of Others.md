# [0747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/)



## Description



You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is **unique**.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is **at least twice** as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return *the **index** of the largest element, or return* `-1` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 is trivially at least twice the value as any other number because there are no other numbers.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- The largest element in `nums` is unique.





## Solutions

### Golang

```go
func dominantIndex(nums []int) int {
    m1, m2, idx := -1, -1, 0
    for i, num := range nums {
        if num > m1 {
            m1, m2, idx = num, m1, i
        } else if num > m2 {
            m2 = num
        }
    }
    if m1 >= m2*2 {
        return idx
    }
    return -1
}
```
