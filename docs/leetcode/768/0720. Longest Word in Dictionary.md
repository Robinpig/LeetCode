# [0720. Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/)



## Description


Given an array of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, return *the longest word in* `words` *that can be built one character at a time by other words in* `words`.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

### **Golang**

```go
type Trie struct {
	children [26]*Trie
	isEnd    bool
}

func (t *Trie) Insert(word string) {
	node := t
	for _, ch := range word {
		ch -= 'a'
		if node.children[ch] == nil {
			node.children[ch] = &Trie{}
		}
		node = node.children[ch]
	}
	node.isEnd = true
}

func (t *Trie) Search(word string) bool {
	node := t
	for _, ch := range word {
		ch -= 'a'
		if node.children[ch] == nil || !node.children[ch].isEnd {
			return false
		}
		node = node.children[ch]
	}
	return true
}

func longestWord(words []string) (longest string) {
	t := &Trie{}
	for _, word := range words {
		t.Insert(word)
	}
	for _, word := range words {
		if t.Search(word) && (len(word) > len(longest) || len(word) == len(longest) && word < longest) {
			longest = word
		}
	}
	return longest
}
