## Solutions

### Golang

```go
var week = []string{"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"}
var monthDays = []int{31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30}

func dayOfTheWeek(day, month, year int) string {
    days := 0
    // 输入年份之前的年份的天数贡献
    days += 365*(year-1971) + (year-1969)/4
    // 输入年份中，输入月份之前的月份的天数贡献
    for _, d := range monthDays[:month-1] {
        days += d
    }
    if month >= 3 && (year%400 == 0 || year%4 == 0 && year%100 != 0) {
        days++
    }
    // 输入月份中的天数贡献
    days += day
    return week[(days+3)%7]
}
```
