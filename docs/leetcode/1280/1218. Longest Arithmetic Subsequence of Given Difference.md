# [1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/)



## Description


Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= arr[i], difference <= 104`

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        int ans = 0;
        int[] dp = new int[40001];
        for (int num : arr) {
            dp[num + 20000] = dp[num + 20000 - difference] + 1; 
            ans = Math.max(ans, dp[num + 20000]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
