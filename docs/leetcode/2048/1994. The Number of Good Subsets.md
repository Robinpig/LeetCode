# [1994. The Number of Good Subsets](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/the-number-of-good-subsets/)



## Description


You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` **good** if its product can be represented as a product of one or more **distinct prime** numbers.

- For example, if

   

  ```
  nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

  :

  - `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.
  - `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.

Return *the number of different **good** subsets in* `nums` ***modulo*** `109 + 7`.

A **subset** of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The good subsets are:
- [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,3,15]
Output: 5
Explanation: The good subsets are:
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [2,15]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [15]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`

### **Golang**

```go
var primes = []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}

func numberOfGoodSubsets(nums []int) (ans int) {
    const mod int = 1e9 + 7
    freq := [31]int{}
    for _, num := range nums {
        freq[num]++
    }

    f := make([]int, 1<<len(primes))
    f[0] = 1
    for i := 0; i < freq[1]; i++ {
        f[0] = f[0] * 2 % mod
    }
next:
    for i := 2; i < 31; i++ {
        if freq[i] == 0 {
            continue
        }

        // 检查 i 的每个质因数是否均不超过 1 个
        subset := 0
        for j, prime := range primes {
            if i%(prime*prime) == 0 {
                continue next
            }
            if i%prime == 0 {
                subset |= 1 << j
            }
        }

        // 动态规划
        for mask := 1 << len(primes); mask > 0; mask-- {
            if mask&subset == subset {
                f[mask] = (f[mask] + f[mask^subset]*freq[i]) % mod
            }
        }
    }

    for _, v := range f[1:] {
        ans = (ans + v) % mod
    }
    return
}
```
