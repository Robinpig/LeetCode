# [2055. Plates Between Candles](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/plates-between-candles/)



## Description


There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a **plate** and a `'|'` represents a **candle**.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [lefti, righti]` denotes the **substring** `s[lefti...righti]` (**inclusive**). For each query, you need to find the **number** of plates **between candles** that are **in the substring**. A plate is considered **between candles** if there is at least one candle to its left **and** at least one candle to its right **in the substring**.

- For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring `"*||***\***|"`. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle **in the substring** to its left **and** right.

Return *an integer array* `answer` *where* `answer[i]` *is the answer to the* `ith` *query*.

 

**Example 1:**

![ex-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-1.png)

```
Input: s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- queries[0] has two plates between candles.
- queries[1] has three plates between candles.
```

**Example 2:**

![ex-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-2.png)

```
Input: s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
Output: [9,0,0,0,0]
Explanation:
- queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
- The other queries have zero plates between candles.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters.
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length`

### **Golang**

```go
func platesBetweenCandles(s string, queries [][]int) []int {
    n := len(s)
    preSum := make([]int, n)
    left := make([]int, n)
    sum, l := 0, -1
    for i, ch := range s {
        if ch == '*' {
            sum++
        } else {
            l = i
        }
        preSum[i] = sum
        left[i] = l
    }

    right := make([]int, n)
    for i, r := n-1, -1; i >= 0; i-- {
        if s[i] == '|' {
            r = i
        }
        right[i] = r
    }

    ans := make([]int, len(queries))
    for i, q := range queries {
        x, y := right[q[0]], left[q[1]]
        if x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < y {
            ans[i] = preSum[y] - preSum[x]
        }
    }
    return ans
}
```
