# [2134. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together-ii/)



## Description


A **swap** is defined as taking two **distinct** positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

A **circular** array is defined as an array where we consider the **first** element and the **last** element to be **adjacent**.

Given a **binary** **circular** array `nums`, return *the minimum number of swaps required to group all* `1`*'s present in the array together at **any location***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
[1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

### **C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int cnt = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        if (cnt == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int cur = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < cnt; ++i) {
            cur += (1 - nums[i]);
        }
        int ans = cur;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i - 1] == 0) {
                --cur;
            }
            if (nums[(i + cnt - 1) % n] == 0) {
                ++cur;
            }
            ans = min(ans, cur);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
