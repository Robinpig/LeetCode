# [0464. Can I Win](https://leetcode.cn/problems/can-i-win/)

## Description


In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to **reach or exceed** 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20`
- `0 <= desiredTotal <= 300`

### **Golang**

```go
func canIWin(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal int) bool {
    if (1+maxChoosableInteger)*maxChoosableInteger/2 < desiredTotal {
        return false
    }

    dp := make([]int8, 1<<maxChoosableInteger)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = -1
    }
    var dfs func(int, int) int8
    dfs = func(usedNum, curTot int) (res int8) {
        dv := &dp[usedNum]
        if *dv != -1 {
            return *dv
        }
        defer func() { *dv = res }()
        for i := 0; i < maxChoosableInteger; i++ {
            if usedNum>>i&1 == 0 && (curTot+i+1 >= desiredTotal || dfs(usedNum|1<<i, curTot+i+1) == 0) {
                return 1
            }
        }
        return
    }
    return dfs(0, 0) == 1
}
```
