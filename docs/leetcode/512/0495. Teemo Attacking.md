# [0495. Teemo Attacking](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/teemo-attacking/)



## Description


Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More formally, an attack at second `t` will mean Ashe is poisoned during the **inclusive** time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again **before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset**, and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return *the **total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= timeSeries.length <= 104`
- `0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 107`
- `timeSeries` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.





## Solutions

### Golang

```go
func findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries []int, duration int) (ans int) {
    expired := 0
    for _, t := range timeSeries {
        if t >= expired {
            ans += duration
        } else {
            ans += t + duration - expired
        }
        expired = t + duration
    }
    return
}
```

### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int pre = timeSeries[0];
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < timeSeries.length; i++){
           int cur = timeSeries[i];
           int sub = cur - pre;
           sum += sub >= duration ? duration : sub;
           pre = cur;
        }
      return sum + duration;
    }
}
```
