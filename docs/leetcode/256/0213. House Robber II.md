# [0213. House Robber II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)



## Description



You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

### **Golang**

```go
func _rob(nums []int) int {
    first, second := nums[0], max(nums[0], nums[1])
    for _, v := range nums[2:] {
        first, second = second, max(first+v, second)
    }
    return second
}

func rob(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    if n == 1 {
        return nums[0]
    }
    if n == 2 {
        return max(nums[0], nums[1])
    }
    return max(_rob(nums[:n-1]), _rob(nums[1:]))
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```
