# [1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-number-of-eaten-apples/)



## Description



There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for `n` days. On the `ith` day, the tree grows `apples[i]` apples that will rot after `days[i]` days, that is on day `i + days[i]` the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by `apples[i] == 0` and `days[i] == 0`.

You decided to eat **at most** one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first `n` days.

Given two integer arrays `days` and `apples` of length `n`, return *the maximum number of apples you can eat.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `apples.length == n`
- `days.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104`
- `days[i] = 0` if and only if `apples[i] = 0`.

### **Golang**

```go
func eatenApples(apples, days []int) (ans int) {
    h := hp{}
    i := 0
    for ; i < len(apples); i++ {
        for len(h) > 0 && h[0].end <= i {
            heap.Pop(&h)
        }
        if apples[i] > 0 {
            heap.Push(&h, pair{i + days[i], apples[i]})
        }
        if len(h) > 0 {
            h[0].left--
            if h[0].left == 0 {
                heap.Pop(&h)
            }
            ans++
        }
    }
    for len(h) > 0 {
        for len(h) > 0 && h[0].end <= i {
            heap.Pop(&h)
        }
        if len(h) == 0 {
            break
        }
        p := heap.Pop(&h).(pair)
        num := min(p.end-i, p.left)
        ans += num
        i += num
    }
    return
}

type pair struct{ end, left int }
type hp []pair

func (h hp) Len() int            { return len(h) }
func (h hp) Less(i, j int) bool  { return h[i].end < h[j].end }
func (h hp) Swap(i, j int)       { h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i] }
func (h *hp) Push(v interface{}) { *h = append(*h, v.(pair)) }
func (h *hp) Pop() interface{}   { a := *h; v := a[len(a)-1]; *h = a[:len(a)-1]; return v }

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return b
    }
    return a
}
