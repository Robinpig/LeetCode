# [1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reconstruct-a-tree/)



## Description


You are given an array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [xi, yi]`, and:

- There are no duplicates.
- `xi < yi`

Let `ways` be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:

- The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in `pairs`.
- A pair `[xi, yi]` exists in `pairs` **if and only if** `xi` is an ancestor of `yi` or `yi` is an ancestor of `xi`.
- **Note:** the tree does not have to be a binary tree.

Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:

- `0` if `ways == 0`
- `1` if `ways == 1`
- `2` if `ways > 1`

A **rooted tree** is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An **ancestor** of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/03/trees2.png)

```
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/03/tree.png)

```
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[1,5]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no valid rooted trees.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= pairs.length <= 105`
- `1 <= xi < yi <= 500`
- The elements in `pairs` are unique.

### **Golang**

```go
func checkWays(pairs [][]int) int {
    adj := map[int]map[int]bool{}
    for _, p := range pairs {
        x, y := p[0], p[1]
        if adj[x] == nil {
            adj[x] = map[int]bool{}
        }
        adj[x][y] = true
        if adj[y] == nil {
            adj[y] = map[int]bool{}
        }
        adj[y][x] = true
    }

    // 检测是否存在根节点
    root := -1
    for node, neighbours := range adj {
        if len(neighbours) == len(adj)-1 {
            root = node
            break
        }
    }
    if root == -1 {
        return 0
    }

    ans := 1
    for node, neighbours := range adj {
        if node == root {
            continue
        }

        currDegree := len(neighbours)
        parent := -1
        parentDegree := math.MaxInt32
        // 根据 degree 的大小找到 node 的父节点 parent
        for neighbour := range neighbours {
            if len(adj[neighbour]) < parentDegree && len(adj[neighbour]) >= currDegree {
                parent = neighbour
                parentDegree = len(adj[neighbour])
            }
        }
        if parent == -1 {
            return 0
        }
        // 检测 neighbours 是否为 adj[parent] 的子集
        for neighbour := range neighbours {
            if neighbour != parent && !adj[parent][neighbour] {
                return 0
            }
        }

        if parentDegree == currDegree {
            ans = 2
        }
    }
    return ans
}
