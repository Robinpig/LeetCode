# [1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/lucky-numbers-in-a-matrix/)



## Description



Given an `m x n` matrix of **distinct** numbers, return *all **lucky numbers** in the matrix in **any** order*.

A **lucky number** is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]
Explanation: 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 50`
- `1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105`.
- All elements in the matrix are distinct.

### **Golang**

```go
func luckyNumbers(matrix [][]int) (ans []int) {
    minRow := make([]int, len(matrix))
    maxCol := make([]int, len(matrix[0]))
    for i, row := range matrix {
        minRow[i] = row[0]
        for j, x := range row {
            minRow[i] = min(minRow[i], x)
            maxCol[j] = max(maxCol[j], x)
        }
    }
    for i, row := range matrix {
        for j, x := range row {
            if x == minRow[i] && x == maxCol[j] {
                ans = append(ans, x)
            }
        }
    }
    return
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return b
    }
    return a
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if b > a {
        return b
    }
    return a
}
