# [0969. Pancake Sorting](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/pancake-sorting/)



## Description


Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

- Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
- Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (**0-indexed**).

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [1,2,3,4]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return *an array of the* `k`*-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort* `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length`
- All integers in `arr` are unique (i.e. `arr` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `arr.length`).

### **Golang**

```go
func pancakeSort(arr []int) (ans []int) {
    for n := len(arr); n > 1; n-- {
        index := 0
        for i, v := range arr[:n] {
            if v > arr[index] {
                index = i
            }
        }
        if index == n-1 {
            continue
        }
        for i, m := 0, index; i < (m+1)/2; i++ {
            arr[i], arr[m-i] = arr[m-i], arr[i]
        }
        for i := 0; i < n/2; i++ {
            arr[i], arr[n-1-i] = arr[n-1-i], arr[i]
        }
        ans = append(ans, index+1, n)
    }
    return
}
```
