# [0953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.cn/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/)

## Description


In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

### **Golang**

```go
func isAlienSorted(words []string, order string) bool {
    index := [26]int{}
    for i, c := range order {
        index[c-'a'] = i
    }
next:
    for i := 1; i < len(words); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(words[i-1]) && j < len(words[i]); j++ {
            pre, cur := index[words[i-1][j]-'a'], index[words[i][j]-'a']
            if pre > cur {
                return false
            }
            if pre < cur {
                continue next
            }
        }
        if len(words[i-1]) > len(words[i]) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```
